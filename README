Widget Title
---------------------------
To change the widget title, edit the language file (en.php) and change the 
string 'simplepie:widget' from 'RSS Feed' to whatever you desire.


Proxy Server
----------------------------
If your site is going through a proxy server to get to the feeds, you may 
want to increase the timeout on the feeds (though this is unlikely as the 
default timeout is 10 seconds). You can do this by editing 
simplepie/views/default/widgets/feed_reader/view.php. There you can just 
uncomment the line $feed->set_timeout(20);


Images
--------------------------
Currently, images are stripped from the feeds as they are likely larger 
than the width of the widget and will cause display issues. To include
images, edit the widget view and add the img tag to the $allow_tags array.
